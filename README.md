# logsiticRegression from Scratch

Applying logistic regression on a single neuron from scratch

* Generates 500 2D data with μ1 = [1, 0], μ2 = [0, 1.5] and σ = [[1,0.75][0.75,1]]
* Data is divided with labels 0 and 1
* Perform logisticRegression on data with learningRate = 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001
* Learn with batchsize = 200 or batchsize = 1 to observe change in accuracy

## Results

We draw a line classifying the 2 datasets based on learnings of the model and draw a scatterplot. 
Accuracy is also measured and displayed
